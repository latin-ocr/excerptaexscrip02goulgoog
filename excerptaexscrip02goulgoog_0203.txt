rescued him from imprisonment, and ungratesully plotted
against the life os his son. His treachery, however, ended

dom, and took possession of the empire of the world. The
sovereignty of the heavensand the earth he reserved to him·-

of ‘blind adoration. The Africana are generally supposed
to have worshipped this deity under the name of Ammon,
the Babylonians as Belus or Bel, and the Egyptians a! ἢ
Osiris.
