ν and Clymene, one of the OceanideS. Proud of his birth,
and distinguished by the favour of Venus, who had confided
one of her temples to his care, he osten boasted of these
honors before EpaphuS, the son of Jupiter and Ιὸ, and ar-
rogantly assumed the ‘superiority over him. In one os the¹
contentions between them, Epaphus to humble the pride of
his companion, denied his divine origin, and charged Cly-

descent from the god of day, advised him to appeal to Phoe-
bus himself, and to repair immediately to his palace. The

tinuance on earth3 but his sorgeS, at which the thunder-
bolts of Jupiter were fabricated, are always placed by the
poets under AEtna‚ a mountain in the island of Sicily, cel-
ebrated for its volcanic eruptione. Through the kind offi-
ces of BacchuS‚ Vulcan was at length reconciled to his
father: he returned to heaven, and became the husband of
