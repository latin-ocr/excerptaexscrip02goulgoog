225· nores

379. Alipedi .· Mercurio is understood.

381. Indotata .· ‘without the dowry, or kingdom,' which
had been promised to bime-Hymenaeus .· ‘ Hymen,’ the son
os Bacchus and VenuS, and the god of marriages. This
deity was supposed by the ancients to be present at all for-
tunate marriages 3 and to shake around him a torch, which
he is represented as always carrying in his hand3 those
nuptials, at which he did not attend, were consequently
supposed to be a source of misery.

387. Cephenis: an adjective agreeing with regis. It
seems the party went from the temple to the palace3 ‘ and
the princes of the AEthiopian monarch go into the splendid
banquet :' not Cepheni or Cephenum.

394. Ora.- the head os Medum, one of the three Gor-
gom, the daughters of the sea deities Phorcys or Phorcus,
and Ceto· Os these sisters Medusa alone was subject to
mortality. As a punishment for the impurity of her con-
duct in her temple, Minerva is said to have changed her
hair into serpente, which had the property of turning all,
who looked at them, into stone. As soon as Perseus had
attained the age os manhood, he promised Polydectes the
head os Medusa as a present, and, as is here related by
ovid, he succeeded in the arduous enterprise os obtaining it.

395. Agenorides : This is the right reading ; and not
Abantiades, as in some MSS. for Danaus the ancestor of
Perseus derived his origin from Agenor.

398. Phorcydas: the Graiae, ὅ the daughters of Phor-
cys,' and the sisters os the Gorgona The accounts, which
the ancient mythologists have, given of the Gorgone and
the Graiae, are very confused and contradictory. They
appear to be osten spoken of as the same personS‚ and the
description, which some poets have given of the one, is ap·
plied by other poets to the other. It seems however to
have been the general opinion that the Graiae were only
two in number, and that they had but one eye and one
tooth between them, which each of them made use os in
her turn. By the assistance of the helmet, which he had
received from Pluto, and which rendered him invisible,
Perseus succeeded in obtaining possession of their eye,
while they were passing it from the one to the other, and
refused to return it, till the sister-s informed him where he
might find the habitation of the Gorgons.

ΙΞί99. Dum traditur .· ⁴ while it is passed stom one to the
ot er!
