BOOK VI.

Niosn, the daughter of Tantalus, passed the early part
of her life in Sipylus, a city of Lydia. She married Am-
phion, king of Thebes, and had seven sons ‘and seven
daughters, of whom she became so rond as to think her-
self superior to Latona and her chil ren, Apollo and Diana.
To punish her insolence, Latona caused 'the death of her
children. Niobe, in her grief, wept herself to death, and
was changed into stone over their tomb.

was so stung with envy and vexation‚ that *she immediately
hanged herself, and while suspended by the cord was
changed ‚by her successful riva} into a spider. · ·
