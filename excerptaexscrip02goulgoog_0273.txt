When the Grecian chiefs were summoned to the siege of
Troy, Ulysses had recently married Penelope, the daughter
of Icarum and unwilling to leave her society, he counter-
leited insanity. Having yoked together a horse and a bull,
he proceeded to plough with them the sand on thesea
shore, and afterwards to sow it with salt. This artifice was
however unsuccessful. Palamedes, the son of Nauplius,
