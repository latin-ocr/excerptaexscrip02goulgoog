AENEAs m· Raetis ALBANI. AEneas was the son of An-
chises and VenuS. He married Creusa„ the daughter of
Priam king of Troy3 and was distinguished for his cour-
age, patriotism, and filial piety. His adventures form the
subject of Virgil’ s celebrated Epic called the AEneid.
When Troy was in flames and every hope of saving it from
destruction was extinguished, AEneas fied from the city,
