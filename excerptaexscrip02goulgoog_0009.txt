PREFACE.

...0—

IN preparing this little volume srom the writings of ovid ,
great care has been taken to admit nothing in the slightest
degree indelicate‚ or improper for the study of youth.
Sufficient attention does not appear to have been* paid to
this] point in the selections from ovid which have commonly
been used in schools. ’

One object has been to furnish examples of the different
kinds· of measure used by this polished and fascinating ‚
⁵ writer. It is not a little surpfising, that in the whole course
of studies preparatory for, and‘ pursued at our collegeS,
notaverse of Pentameter measure occurs* There are a
few lines of the Elegiae measure in theCoUectanea Grae-
ca Minora, which formerly served as a text, whereby to
explain this measure3 but since the exclusion of tha't· ex-
cellent book from the requisitions sor entrance, nothing os
the kind remainS, either os Greek or Latin, in the whole
course. '

This is the more surprising‚ since. in addition to the
frequency with which this kind of versification occurs, it
may be considered one os the most easy and graceful
which the ancient poets used.

*There may bc exceptions to this remark, although there is none
within the writer’s knowledge.
