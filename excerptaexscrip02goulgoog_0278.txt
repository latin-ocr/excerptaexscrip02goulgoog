200. Helenam .· Helen, the daughter of Jupiter and Le-
da, was the wife of Tyndarus, king of Sparta. Her beauty
was so remarkable even in her infancy‚ that she was car·
ried off by Theseus before she had attained her tenth year,
and detained by him at Aphidnae in Attica, till she was rescu-
ed by her brothers Castor and Pollux. Her hand was eagerly
solicited of her father by all the princes of Greece3 but be·
ing lest to make her own choice‚ she selected for her hus-
band Menelaus, the brother of Agamemnon, to whom Tyn-
darus soon aster resigned his kingdom. At the marriage
of Helen, all the Grecian chiefS‚ who had sought-her hand,
pledged themselves to defend her person· and character
from injury and violence. About this period a contention
was excited by ¹the goddess of discord between J uno, Ve-
nus, and Minerva. Each of these goddesses claimed the
superiority in beauty‚ and they agreed at length to submit
the dispute to the decision of Paris, a son of Priam, who
was living as a shepherd on mount Ida. Paris deoided
in favour of Venus, and received from her a promise of the
⁷ most beautiful woman in he world sor his wife. This
promised reward he was soon informed was Helen, the
bride of Menelaas, and he accordingly set sail for Sparta.
to obtain her. Here he was received and entertained with
every mark of respect, until he basely abused the laws of
hospitality: during a temporary absence o'f the king from
his court, he prevailed on the faithless Helen to accompany
him to Asia. Their flight occasioned the most celebrated
war recorded in the annals of fabulous or authentis history.
