CA'mws was the son of Agenor, king of Phoenicia. J u·
piter, having transformed himself into a bull, prevailed on
Europa, the sister of this prince‚ to get on his back, and
immediately plunging into the sea, he carried her across it
into Crete. Agenor, ignorant of the fate of his daugh-
ter and disconsolate at her loss, ordered Cadmus to go in
search of Europa3 with a command not to return to Phoe-
nicia till he had found her. The pursuit of Cadmus was
fruitless He could hear no tidings of his sister, and not
daring to return to his native land without her, he resolved
to consult the oracle of Apollo at Delphi, th'at he might
know ιιι what part of the earth to fix his abode.

The oracle directed him to follow a heifer, which was de·
scribed to him, and wherever she should lie down, there to
build a city, and to call the country Boeotia. Cadmus soon
found the heifer‚ and put himself under her guidance3 she
at length lay down near the banks of the river Cephisus,
where he prepared to commence the city according to the
directions of the oracle. Here the present account begins,
The spot is a little north of Attica. Cadmus is supposed
to have come into Greece A. C. 1493‚· and to have
brought with him the use of letters, and the worship of
