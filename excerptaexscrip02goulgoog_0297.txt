Elusus Ι. pannum 'ro ULYssEs.

Amare the destruction of Troy, as the victorious Greeks
were returning home, they were retarded by storms and
driven to various parts of the world, in consequence of hav-
ing offended Minerva, Some of them were made to wander
for ten years in quest of their country. Among these was
