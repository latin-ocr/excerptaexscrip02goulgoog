BOOK IX.

Mons Huncuus. Hercules was the son of Jupiter
and Alcmena, and the most illustrious hero of antiqmty.
Fated from his birth to be subservierit to the will of Eu·
rystheus, a jealous and cruel king of Argos and Myce-
ηε, he was exposed by him to innumerable dangers, and
compelled to undertake the perilous enterprises, which have
been denominated the twelve ἰαῦσαι-ε of Hercules. After·
these and many other dangers, which the enmity of Juno
brought upon him, had been successfiilly encountered, Her-
cules went to Calydon to the court of OEneus, king of AEto—
lia, and became one of the suitors of his daughter DejanIra,
who had been promised in marriage to the herc, who
should overcome his rivals. Achelous alone was willing to
contend with him for the prize, in the contest which ensu-
ed 3 but finding himself inferior to his opponent in strength,
he had recourse to stratagem‚ and changed himself, first in-
’ to a serpent, and then into an ox. While wrestling with
him in the latter shape‚ Herciiles wrung off one of his
horns 3 and the loss so filled Achelous with shame and hu-
miliation, that he submitted to his adversary, and was im-
mediately changed into a river. To console him for this
defeat, the horn, which he had lost, was taken up by the
Naiades, and filled by the goddess of Plenty with the fruits
of autumn, and received the name of Cornucopia, or the
Horn of Plenty. Returning from AEtolia in triumph with
his bride, Hercules was stopped in his course by the swol·
len streams of the Evenus3 and was induced tocommit De-
janira to the care of the centaur Nessus, who engaged to
carry her in safety to the other side of the river. No soon-
er however had he arrived with her on the opposite bank,
than he began to abuse his trust, and to treat with cruelty
his charge. Alarmed by her cries, Hercules aimed a poi-
soned arrow at the perfidious centaur, who, wounded and

' dying, gave Dejanira a gai-ment dipped in his blood, which

he pretended had the power of recalling the affections of
her husband, if ever they should become estranged from
her. Dejanira received the gift, 'and aster having been
joined by her husband, accompanied him to the court of
Ceyx, king of Trachinia.
