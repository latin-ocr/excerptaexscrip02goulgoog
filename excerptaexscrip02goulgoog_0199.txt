THE METAMORPHOSES.

...Φ-ἱ-

BOOK I.

Pnnnms Ovmms NAso, a celebrated Roman poet, was
born at Sulmo, a town os the Peligni, about forty years be-
fore the Christian era. His parents were of equestrian
rank, and educated their son for the bar ; but he soon for-
sook this and every other pursuit for the cultivation of poet..
ry, and at length became one of the most admired and
eminent poets in the court of Augustus, His prosperity

' waS, however, of short continuance. Having incurred‚ by

some unknown offence, the displeasure of the emperor, he
was banished to TomOS, a town near the Euxine sea3
where, after many ineffectual attempts to obtain the pardon
of AugustuS, he ended his dayS, in the eighth year of his
banishment, and the fifty-ninth year of his age. The poet-
ry of Ovid has long been celebrated for its variety, sweet.
ness, and elegance. But the frequent viciations of modes-
ty, which disgrace some parts of his writings‚ detract much
from the merit of this giftei poet. His Metamorphoses,
though not the most finished of his poemS, may perhaps be
considered the most curious and valuable. He has there
preserved the various mythological traditionS, which-cxisted
among the ancients‚ and happily connected them with each
other. Many of these traditions appear to have been orig-
inally founded on historical facts3 but it is, in most instan-
ceS, impossible to trace the truths of history through the

tales of superstition and the fictions of poetry.
