109. Soceri tibi .· ‘ your father and mother in law.' Cad-
muS, aster he settled in dreece, married Hermione, who
was said to be the daughter of Mars and Venus.

Mars was the son of Jupiter and J uno. He was wor-
shipped by the Romans and in some parts of Greece‚ as the
god of armies and war. Venus was the goddess of beauty,
pleasure‚ and love, and the most beautiful of all the god-
desses. Venus is said to have sprung from the froth·0f the
sea, near the island of Cyprus. Having displeased Jupiter
soon after she was carried to heaven, he offered her in mar-
riage to the ugly and deformed Vulcan‚ whom she was
compelled to marry. Cupid and Hymen were her children,
¹ as well as the Graces and the hero AEneas, The history of
Venae, like that of the heathen deities in general, is little
more than a disgusting history of licentiousness and crimes3
yet her worship was once universally established in the
Greek and Roman empires. The placeS‚ in which she was
most particularly honored, were AmathuS, Cythera, and Pa·
phos· ,
112. Hos quoque jam juvenes .- ‘ and these too now
grown up.'-—Sed, scilicet, . . . debet .· this sentence appears
to be a translation of a celebrated saying of the philosopher
Solon to CroesuS‚ a powerful and opulent monarch of Lydia.
This prince, boasting before Solon of his prosperity and hap-
pineSS, was reminded by him, that the instability of human
affairs was such, that no man could properly be called leap-
Py before the day of his death. Soon after his inter-view
with the philosopher, Croesus was taken captive by Cyrus,
king os Persia, and condemned to be burnt. When' placed ι
on the pile, the unfortunate prince remembered the words
of Solon, and with a piercing cry thrice repeated his name.
This involuntary exclamation saved his life. Cyrus order-
ed him to be taken from the pile, and having heard the his-
tory of his conversation with Solon, set him at liberty, and
made him one of his most intimate friends 2 ·
