source of this celebrated river, though it was for ages a sub«
ject of inquiry‚ remained unknown till a few years since;
when the traveller Bruce is said to have discovered it. Itis
now ascertained that it takes its rise in Abyssinia‚ and after
flowing through Abex‚ Nubis„ and Egypt, it empties itself by
seven mouths or channels into the Mediteranean sea, near
the city Alexandri& The Nile annually overflows its banks
about the latter end of May, and for four months the country
of Egypt is covered with its waterS. This inundation is
said to be occasioned by the periodical rains which fall when
the sun is vertical in Ethiopia in the months os April and
May; and though it is sometimes dangerous and desolating
in its consequences when the rise of the waters is excessive‚
it is in general attended with the most beneficial effectS,
fertilizing the lamis, and enriching the nativeS.
