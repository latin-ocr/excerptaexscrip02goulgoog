Cassan. Julius Caesar was one of the most celebrated of
the Roman Emperors‚ and from him the name of Caesar ἶ
was transmitted to the Subsequent EmperorS. Endowed
with extraordinary talenta, and influenced by boundless
ambition, he made himself master of the libel-ties of his·
country, and assumed at length the imperial power. His
reign was however of short continuance. Α conspiracy
was formed against him with Brutus and, Cassius at its
,head3 and he was assassinated in the senate-house, on' the
Ides of March, forty-four years before the Christian era.
Soon after his death a new star, or rather comet, was seen
in the heavens3 and the abject flatterers of Augustus, the
nephew and successor os Julius, declared it t'o be the depart-
ed emperor, who had taken his place among the gods. A
temple was accordingly erected to him, and priests appointw
· ed to superintend his worship. Neither was this honour
confined to him alone. Augustus himself, even before his
death, was ranked among the gode, and altars were raised
to him in almost every city of the Roman empire.

“ 199. Marte togaque .- ‘ in war and in peace.'
