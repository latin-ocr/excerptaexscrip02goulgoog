iv · meriton.

As this book is designed sor a kind of introduction to
fabulous history, the notes give a more full account os the
subjects connected with the matter immediately under con-
sideration, than might otherwise seem expedient. And this
is the more necessary from the circumstance, that boys are
not usually intrusted with a Classical Dictionary at so early
an age as this book will probably be given to them. For
this reason very little reference has been made to Lem-
pnere.

The Questions are designed to direct the student’s ’

attention to the subjects os the noteS, as well as to those os
the text3 sor a knowledge os the characters here intro-
duced will greatly facilitate a proper understanding of all
subsequent studies in Latin and Greek. The text is Bur-

mann ’.s The selection from the Metamorphoses is the Ι
same with that published m England by Mr. Bradley, with

some slight expurgation. The remaining portion was se-
lected and expurgated for the occasion.

In preparing the noteS, the editions os Burmann, Schre-
veliuS, Minellius, Banier, and the Delphin edition, have
been consulted 3 and the notes of Mr. Bradley have been
used, wherever they conformed to the plan of this work.
