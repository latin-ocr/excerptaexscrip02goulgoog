218 NOTES.

the gode, having previously sworn by the Stygian waves to
give her whatsoever she should ask, was constrained to
comply with her request3 and although he endeavoured to
lessen the terrors of his dignity‚ the daughter of Cadmus
was unable to bear the shock of his appearance, and was
reduced to ashes in his presence. Her child however was
saved from destruction. Jupiter entrusted him to the care
of Silenus and the nymphs in the island of Naxos, one of
the Cyclades As Bacchus first invented the art of making
wine, he was considered as the god of wine, and of
drinkerS. He is generally represented as holding in his
hand, instead of a sceptre, a thyrsuS, or small lance cover·
ed with ivy and vine leaves. The worship of this deity was
conducted in the wildest and most licentious manner. His
worshipperS‚ clothed in the skins of tigerS, or of panthers,
crowned with garlanda of ivy, the vine, or the fir, and car·
ryiug lighted torches in their hands, ran about in the open
air in all the wildness of frenzy, shouting ‘ Evoe Evan,' or
κ ‘Good Son ; ’ a name given by Jupiter to Bacchus, for the
intrepid bravery, which he manifested on his behalf in the
war with the Giants. These rites‚ which were celebrated
principally in Greece, were called Dionysia, Bacchanalia,
Triaria, or OrgieS. ’
