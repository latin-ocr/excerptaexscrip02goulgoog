desert, in which destitute situation she was discovered by
Simmas, a shepherd, who saved her from perishing, and
brought her up as his own child. Having married Meno-
nes, the governor of Nineveh, she was present with her hus·
band at the siege of Bactra, where her beauty and talents
so much attracted the admiration of Ninus, the son of Be-
lus and the first king of Assyria, that he resolved to make
het his queen. Menones at first refused to give up his
wife, but dreading the resentment of the king, he at length
destroyed himself, and Simirimis immediately became the
consort of Ninus. But even this elevated station could not
satisfy her boundless ambition. She soon prevailed on the
king to resign his crown to her, and afterwards established
herself on his throne by putting him to death. Her reign
was however distinguished by acts of beneficence and great-
nesS. Babylon, the capital of her empire, remained for
ages a celebrated monument of her magnificence. If not
originally built by her, it was so much enlarged and embel-
lished by this queen, that it became the most superb city in
the world.
